# Snitching on Sinatra

Snitching on Sinatra is a tutorial that will lead you through building two web
applications. 

Feel free to fork this repo and push your changes up to your fork as you
work!

## [Part 1: Web Application Basics](part1.md)
Part 1 will lead you through how to build a web application using Sinatra. It 
goes over URL parameters, HTTP methods, and getting data from users.

## [Interlude: Restarting That Script, Though...](part1-5.md)
Manually restarting the script is so annoying. Let's use `shotgun` so we never 
(or pretty much never) have to manually restart our server again!

## [Part 2: Data, Parameters, and POST](part2.md)
Part 2 will lead you through sharing data between controllers and views, URL
parameters, and how to send data from the browser to the server using the HTTP
POST method.

## [Part 3: Todoolittle](part3.md)
In part 3, you'll build a web application to create Todo items and store them
using ActiveRecord.
